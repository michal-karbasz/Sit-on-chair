# Sit on chair HTML/CSS workshop

A simple project that consisted on recreating HTML structure and CSS styling
based on an image. It was made (by myself:)) after 1st week at Coders Lab bootcamp. 
Please note that this <emphasize>isn't</emphasize> to present my actual HTML/CSS skills but the ones I had after 5 days learning. 

After another week I've added some simple JavaScript functionality (slider, disappearing image descriptions on mouse enter that reappear on mouse leave).
